All Hopper Buses are modern and low floor, providing easy access for staff and students.

Hopper Buses have a wheelchair bay on board, which can carry 1 wheelchair at a time. We also support the CPT Motor Scooter Code, which allows scooter holders with permits to travel. Contact us to be assessed.

Other people on the bus may use this area and our driver will request they move, should a wheelchair user wish to board. However, the driver has no rights to force people to move from this area.

All Hopper Buses have audio and visual next stop announcements on board, to help you find your stop.
